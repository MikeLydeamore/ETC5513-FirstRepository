```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-penguins
#| fig-cap: "Bill length and depth of penguins, coloured by species"
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm, colour=species)) +
  geom_point()
```

We can see in @fig-penguins that there is separation between species. See @sec-transpose for more information.
